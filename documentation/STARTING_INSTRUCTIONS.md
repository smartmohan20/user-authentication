# Project Staring Instructions
## Running the Project

To run the TypeScript Node.js project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

2. **Build and Start:**
   - Compile the TypeScript code and generate the `dist` directory:
     ```bash
     yarn build
     ```
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     yarn start
     ```

   This will execute the compiled `dist/server.js` file, launching your Node.js application.

## Additional Information

- The `yarn install` command installs all project dependencies.
- The `yarn build` command compiles the TypeScript code and creates the `dist` directory.
- The `yarn start` command starts the Node.js server.

Now, your TypeScript Node.js project should be up and running. Open your web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL or endpoint to access your application.
